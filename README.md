# Markov-Modelling

This project utilizes R programming language to explore Markov Chain modeling and analysis. The code within this repository demonstrates various functionalities related to Markov chains, focusing on driver movements and match result sequences.

Key Features
Markov Chain Creation: Defines state spaces and transition probabilities for driver movements and match results.
Chain Analysis: Calculates probabilities, checks chain properties (e.g., irreducibility), and determines steady states.
Data Export and Manipulation: Converts Markov chains into data frames and estimates parameters using different methods.
Visualization: Generates visual representations of transition diagrams using appropriate R packages.
